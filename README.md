Developed a responsive weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.  Implemented features like city search, current location weather (geolocation API), and detailed weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise/sunset, pressure, clouds, visibility).
